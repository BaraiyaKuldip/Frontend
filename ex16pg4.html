<h1>Plot</h1>

Muthuvel Pandian is a retired police officer who lives in Kodambakkam with his family. Muthuvel's son ACP Arjun is investigating Varman, an eccentric gangster operating from his base of operations in Arakkonam, who smuggles idols of gods and sells them to buyers overseas. Arjun confronts Varman's henchman Seenu and demands him about the whereabouts of Varman. While getting closer in nabbing Varman, Arjun suddenly goes missing and the police department covers up his murder by spreading word that he may have committed suicide due to the stress of the job. <br>

Grieving the loss of his son and partly blaming himself for raising him to be honest and fearless, Muthuvel goes after Seenu and murders him, disposing the body by coercing a clueless local taxi driver Vimal into helping him. In retaliation, Varman's men attempt to kill Muthuvel's grandson Rithvik, but Muthuvel manages to save him. Muthuvel tries to convince Varman to leave him and his family alone, but to no avail. Enraged, he decides to fight back. <br>

First, Muthuvel blackmails a psychiatrist S. Dhandapani into providing asylum for his family. He then visits Narasimha, a reformed criminal living in Mandya, who loans him four of his sharpest shooters. With the help of Narasimha's men, Muthuvel steals Varman's idols that were being smuggled and uses them to blackmail and humiliate Varman, who was about to kill his family. In response, Varman tells a Bihari gangster named Kamdev to send people to kill Muthuvel and his family at his home, but Muthuvel and Narasimha's men finishes them off. On discovering Varman's target to be Muthuvel, Kamdev reveals to him that Muthuvel was the former ruthless and charismatic jailer of Tihar prison who disciplined the criminals harshly but also helped them reform, thus gaining a massive network of allies, including Kamdev. <br>

Muthuvel corners Varman in his base along with a hundred men sent by another former criminal Sikandar Singh, but Varman reveals that Arjun is still alive and threatens to kill him. Both of them ultimately arrive at a compromise: Varman will release Arjun in exchange for retrieving a famous antique crown that is currently secure in a temple in Mangalagiri. Muthuvel plans a heist involving the Telugu actor Blast Mohan, who is a trustee of the temple where the crown is held. After various deceptions and with the help of a smuggler in Mumbai named Mathew, Muthuvel eventually comes into possession of the crown and sends it to Varman, but it is later revealed that the crown which Muthuvel sent was a fake. <br>

Varman frees Arjun, who reveals himself as a corrupt police officer wanting to be cut in on Varman's operations, willing to kill his own father for money. However, the fake crown also conceals a hidden camera and their entire conversation is seen by Muthuvel. He attacks Varman's hideout with Kamdev, Vimal, and his allies, killing Varman and his men, while Narasimha protects Muthuvel's family and Mathew destroys Varman's smuggling operations. Muthuvel gives Arjun one chance to surrender, but he refuses and attempts to kill him. Arjun is shot and killed by Narasimha's men, while Muthuvel solemnly walks away. <br>
