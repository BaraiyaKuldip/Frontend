                            Tiger 3 is a 2023 Indian Hindi-language action thriller film directed by Maneesh Sharma and produced by Aditya Chopra under Yash Raj Films. The film stars Salman Khan, Katrina Kaif and Emraan Hashmi. It is a sequel to Tiger Zinda Hai (2017) and is the fifth installment in the YRF Spy Universe. The film is set after the events of Tiger Zinda Hai (2017), War (2019) and Pathaan (2023). Following the events of Tiger Zinda Hai, Tiger and Zoya are framed as traitors by an ex-ISI agent named Aatish Rehman, where they go on a life-threatening crusade to clear their names. <br>
    
    Principal photography began in March 2021 with filming taking place in Delhi, Mumbai, Istanbul, Saint Petersburg and Vienna. The film's soundtrack is composed by Pritam while background score is composed by Tanuj Tiku. The film was made at an estimated budget of ₹300 crore, thus making it the most expensive project of Yash Raj Films. <br>
    
    Tiger 3 was released on 12 November 2023 in standard, IMAX, 4DX and other premium formats, coinciding with Diwali, where it received mixed to positive reviews from critics with praise for its cast performances (particularly Khan, Kaif and Hashmi), action sequences and technical aspects, but criticized its plot, soundtrack and pace. <br>
    <h1>Plot</h1>
    
    In 1999, Zoya witnesses her father, ISI agent Rehan Nazar, die in a car bomb blast. After his funeral, Zoya is recruited by Aatish Rehman, Nazar's protégé, to join the ISI. <br>
    
    In the present day, Avinash "Tiger" Singh Rathore is called for a mission by RAW chief Maithili Menon to rescue Tiger's former handler Gopi Arya, who was captured after trying to extract information about a mission being planned in Pakistan. Following his rescue, Gopi reveals that Zoya is involved in the planned mission, and dies shortly after. Tiger begins spying on Zoya and is later assigned to safeguard a RAW agent named Jibran Sheikh in Russia, who worked with Gopi and escaped to the country after being exposed in Pakistan. <br>
    
    Tiger witnesses Zoya attempt to assassinate Sheikh; after saving him, Tiger is captured by Aatish, who reveals he forced Zoya to assassinate Sheikh by near fatally drugging and kidnapping her and Tiger's son, Junior. Tiger and Zoya recruit their team of RAW agents to steal a briefcase for Aatish, containing missile launch codes in Istanbul in exchange for Junior. Aatish then has Tiger and Zoya framed as traitors by their respective countries, leading to Tiger's imprisonment in Pakistan. <br>
    
    In a flashback sequence, it is revealed Aatish sought to derail a peace treaty between India and Pakistan in Vienna by assassinating the lead Indian army general twelve years earlier. After Zoya refuses to co-operate with the plan, she covertly informs Tiger. Aatish's pregnant wife, Shaheen Baig, attempts the assassination but is shot and killed by Tiger. Aatish denies that his agents knew of the plan, and is subsequently imprisoned and ousted from the ISI. <br>
    
    Tiger is given the death penalty, but manages to escape prison with the help of Pathaan. He travels to Islamabad where he meets his adopted son, Hassan, a hacker, who Tiger had previously saved from a terrorist group as a child. Tiger's team, Zoya and ISI agents Abrar and Javed return to Istanbul, where they learn that Aatish and Pakistani Army General Imtiaz Haq are planning to assassinate Pakistani Prime Minister Nasreen Irani, in order for Aatish to replace her. Tiger, Zoya and their team secretly enter the Prime Minister's Office and reveal the plan to Irani. <br>
    
    Tiger and Zoya take Irani to an underground bunker and Tiger forces Haq to publicly reveal the plan. However, Aatish secretly kills Haq with the help of Javed, who is revealed to be Shaheen's brother, and frames Tiger for killing Haq. Abrar and Karan, members of Tiger's crew, are killed by Aatish and Javed, who locate Irani. Tiger and Zoya help Irani escape, but Hassan and Javed are killed. Tiger and Aatish engage in a combat, resulting in Tiger killing Aatish. Irani exposes Aatish to the public and Tiger, Zoya and their team are proven innocent. <br>
    
    In the post-credits scene, Colonel Sunil Luthra contacts Kabir Dhaliwal and tasks him to assassinate an unidentified person. <br>
